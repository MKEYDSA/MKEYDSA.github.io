          <p>The Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) are the youth section of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). YDSA has a proud history of organizing for justice. As an organization of youth and student activists, YDSA was heavily involved in the movement in the eighties against apartheid in South Africa and the movement against the prison industrial complex that grew in the nineties. We continue to play a principled role in struggles for social and economic justice - fighting for change in our communities, on our campuses, at the ballot box, and beyond.</p>
